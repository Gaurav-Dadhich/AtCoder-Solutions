Problem Statement
There are N boxes arranged in a row, and some of these boxes contain cookies.
The state of these boxes is represented by a string S of length N. Specifically, the i-th box 
(1≤i≤N) from the left contains one cookie if the i-th character of S is @, and is empty if it is ..

Over the next D days, Takahashi will choose and eat one cookie per day from among the cookies in these boxes.

Determine how many of the N boxes will be empty after D days have passed. 
(It can be proved that this value does not depend on which cookies Takahashi chooses each day.)

It is guaranteed that S contains at least D occurrences of @.

Constraints
1≤D≤N≤100
N and D are integers.
S is a string of length N consisting of @ and ..
S contains at least D occurrences of @.
